 # Data Mining and Machine Learning Project - Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a marketing campaign dataset for a retailer company using Random Forest and Logistic Regression algorithms for machine learning. The goal is to develop predictive models that can help the company optimize its marketing strategies and improve campaign effectiveness.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about past marketing campaigns conducted by the retailer company. It includes various features such as customer demographics, campaign details, customer responses, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is available in CSV format and is located in the `data` directory.


## Results
The project results include trained machine learning models for Random Forest and Logistic Regression, along with evaluation metrics and visualizations. 

Additionally, the evaluation script generates performance metrics and visualizations, which can be used to assess the models' predictive capabilities and make informed decisions for future marketing campaigns.
